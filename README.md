# Capstone-Project-1
Cybercrime in India is a research-based project where we perform descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis on malware attacks, credit/debit card frauds, and online banking frauds using machine learning. Data cleaning was done in RStudio, and visualizations were created in Tableau.
